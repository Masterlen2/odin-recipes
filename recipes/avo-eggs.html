    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by toasting the bread until it reaches your desired level of crispiness. Set aside once toasted.</li>
        <li>While the bread is toasting, crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them together until well combined. 
            Season with a pinch of salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and lightly coat it with cooking spray or a small amount of oil.</li>
        <li>Pour the whisked eggs into the skillet, stirring gently with a spatula as they cook. 
            Continue to stir occasionally until the eggs are scrambled and cooked to your liking, usually about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the eggs are cooking, halve the avocado, remove the pit, and scoop the flesh into a bowl. 
            Mash the avocado with a fork until smooth or leave it slightly chunky if desired. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Once the eggs are cooked, remove them from the heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Take the toasted bread slices and spread the mashed avocado evenly over each slice.</li>
        <li>Spoon the scrambled eggs on top of the avocado-covered toast.</li>
        <li>If desired, garnish with a dash of hot sauce or chopped fresh herbs for an extra kick of flavor.</li>
